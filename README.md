It combines basmati rice with marinated beef, a variety of spices, and sometimes vegetables, creating a rich and satisfying meal. The dish is known for its complex flavors and is often served during special occasions and gatherings.

Cooking Method
Marinate the Beef: Combine yogurt with spices like ginger, garlic, turmeric, and garam masala to marinate the beef for several hours.
Prepare the Rice: Soak basmati rice to ensure even cooking.
Cook the Beef: Sauté onions until golden brown, add marinated beef, and cook until tender.
Layering: In a pot, layer partially cooked rice over the beef mixture, adding saffron-infused water for color and flavor.
